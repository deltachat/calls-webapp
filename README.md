# WebRTC call-via-clipboard component

This is a call-via-clipboard React application written in TypeScript.

Build it with:
```
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

Then open `index.html` in the browser.

Inspired by [Serverless WebRTC][serverless-webrtc] but built from scratch and much simpler:
no data channel, file transfer and only browsers are supported.

See blog posts explaining the idea here:

* [WebRTC without a signaling server](https://blog.printf.net/articles/2013/05/17/webrtc-without-a-signaling-server/)
* [Serverless WebRTC, continued](https://blog.printf.net/articles/2014/07/01/serverless-webrtc-continued/)
